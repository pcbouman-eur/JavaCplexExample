## Java and CPLEX example project: Precendence Constrained Knapsack Problem

This is a project page for a small example project that showcases how to use CPLEX from Java. It solves the Precedence Constrained Knapsack Problem, but is a useful example if you intend to implement other optimization problems that involve (directed) graphs.

* IBM offers free versions of the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio. You can got to [https://www.ibm.com/academic/topic/data-science](https://www.ibm.com/academic/topic/data-science) and create an IBM account with your EUR e-mail. You land on a general site "Data Science". If you scroll down there is a tab "Software". Click on "Software" and then under ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio on Download. Your browser may suppress a pop-up, so make sure you allow the IBM website to show popups. In the pop-up, I advise to choose HTTP and select the CPLEX version appropriate for you operating system.
* View the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pcbouman-eur/JavaCplexExample) which has a more in-depth explanation. This also contains a more advanced column generation example, but these examples are separate.
